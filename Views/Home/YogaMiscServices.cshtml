		<div class="et_pb_text_inner">Ayurveda originated in India more than 5,000 years ago and is the oldest continuously practiced health-care system in the world. Drawn from an understanding of nature’s rhythms and laws, Ayurveda is built around the five elements of ether, air, fire, water, and earth.<p></p>
			<p>It is understood in Ayurveda that humans, as natural beings, are governed by the same rules and laws as all other natural beings. If we choose to ignore these laws, then imbalances will begin to appear. These imbalances are the precursor to disharmony and disease in the mind and body. This system of medicine understands our deepest connections with the whole universe and the influences of the energies that make up this universe. We are considered a microcosm of the macrocosm.</p>
			<p>An Ayurvedic approach treats each individual, taking into account his/her own unique psychological, emotional, and physical conditions. Imbalances in the body are evaluated through the system of the elements. Because our world and bodies are constantly adjusting to new environments, when these environments become imbalanced we feel it in some way.</p>
			<p>The goal of Ayurveda is to teach people how to attain optimal health through a deeper understanding of themselves and their own particular nature in relationship to the world around them. It is a system based on natural healing through strengthening the body, mind, and spirit and allowing the body’s own natural healing mechanisms to work to their fullest potential.</p></div>

			<div style="text-align:center;"><h5>Tridosha</h5><br />Doshas are defined as energetic principles that govern physiological functions of the body. There are three Doshas: Vata, Pitta, Kapha. Health exists when there is a balance between these three fundamental body doshas.</div>

			<h4><span>Ayurvedic massage (Abhyanga)</span></h4>
			<p>Abhyanga is an ancient Indian Ayurvedic oil massage therapy for healing and detoxifying Body, Mind, and Spirit. This ayurvedic detox and stress reduction therapy is performed by herbal oils. It incorporates an aromatic combination of oils prepared with herbs warmed and blended to your Dosha type. Lymphatic stimulation with ayurvedic herbal oils helps squeeze out toxic accumulation from channels.</p>
			<p>The highlight of Ayurvedic massages is the oils used – essential to eliminate friction and to spread heat evenly through the body. These oils are medicated to balance dosha energies – sesame, coconut and mustard/olive oils are used to stabilize dominant Vata, Pitta, and Kapha respectively. The purpose of an Ayurvedic massage is to help break down and remove toxins in the body, strengthen muscle tone and assist in the relaxation and rejuvenation of the body. Massages also nourish the body, help sleeping patterns, improve circulation and strengthen the body’s tolerance of diseases.</p>

		<p>Kizhi is an Ayurvedic treatment in which warm poultices filled with herbal oils, powders or medical concoctions are applied and massaged over the body. The natural healing herbs are crushed and bundled into muslin cloth to form boluses. Warm poultices are used to massage the body (or specific parts), to induce sudation (sweat).</p>
		<p>Podikizhi helps in curing ‘Kapha-Vata’ predominant conditions of arthritis, back pain, paralysis, and muscular pains. This treatment is useful for relieving deep seated tension, increasing circulation, loosening built up toxins, strengthening muscle tissue and ridding the body of excess Kapha. It is prescribed for diseases where there is vitiation of kapha, the heaviness of body, extremities, and obesity.</p>

			<h4><span>Deep tissue massage</span></h4>
			<p>An intensive treatment that works on neuromuscular tissues, strengthens the nervous system and tones the body. The strong and vigorous massages with deep pressure used in the strokes help the very stressed body and also helps in weight loss. It tones the muscles and helps to get rid off deep-seated toxins.</p>
			<p>Due to stress and other factors, the layer of connective tissue that covers and interpenetrates the body’s muscles and bones—the fascia—often tenses up, resulting in muscle knots and a painful buildup of lactic acid. Deep-tissue massage aims to warm up the fascia and release the accumulated toxins. To achieve this, the therapist’s fingers, thumbs, and elbows move along the body in slow, deliberate strokes, applying pressure to penetrate beyond superficial muscle layers. Although the intensity can produce some discomfort, deep-tissue massage should still be relaxing; the goal, after all, is to relieve the tension between muscles and their weird roommate, the skeleton.</p>

			<h4 class="et_pb_module_header"><span>Foot &amp; Leg massage</span></h4>
			<div><p>The ancient healing traditions of the East, especially the Ayurvedic tradition, place an equal importance on feet. Ayurvedic foot massages use herbal oils with their own individual therapeutic benefits to effectively combine into the movement of energy in the massages. With many nerves from vital organs ending in the feet, foot massages benefit the entire body rendering revitalized energy, enhanced blood and lymph circulation, strengthening and restoring nerves, improving skin and alleviating stress. By stimulating vital points (marma) a balance of ‘doshas’ is achieved, resulting in homeostasis, a state when all the body’s systems are working in harmony with one another to bring about a state of balance. The healing power of Ayurvedic treatments has been scientifically proven by several studies. Research has shown that Ayurvedic foot massages can effectively heal headaches and migraines. &nbsp;</p></div>
