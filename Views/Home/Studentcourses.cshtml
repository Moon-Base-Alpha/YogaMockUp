                <h1>Our teaching</h1>
                Our aim is to give each student a clear and proper knowledge of yoga so that you can establish a daily practice in order to improve your physical and mental well-being. We do not focus on the number of Asanas that we practice but to practice each asana in the correct way with inner awareness.
                As teachers of the ancient knowledge of yoga, we are honored to share the knowledge we have received from our teachers and through our own yoga practice. We feel very blessed of being able to help, inspire and guide our students on the path of yoga towards a happier, healthier and more peaceful life.
                We always try to give each student in a class individual attention. It can be a gentle correction in a posture or a verbal instruction.
